The Social Media Manager's main purpose is to manage multiple social media platforms for one user. Ideally each social media would have 
the feed displayed on it's own tab in the app, and it would also allow the user to make a post on each individual social media. The manager 
would also have an all tab, which would allow the user to post on every social media they signed into at once.
